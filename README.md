This is a information website for the sport of Ice Hockey. It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices, allowing for the max amount of people to be able to access it and it's information.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and be able to learn some basic history and rules of the sport.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be further expand my knowledge and understanding of the information by using the links to other external sources provided.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the information is updated and correct, as and when it changes.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find that the links are all working and up to date.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Charcoal Grey and Blue. This is because both work well on the White background and they both also are related to Ice Hockey as Charcoal Grey is very similar to the color of a puck and the Blue is similar to the Blue lines on the rink.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Raleway font is used for the text throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly, whilst Abyssinica SIL font is used for the headings throughout with Serif as the fallback font. Both Raleway and Abyssinica SIL are both clean fonts, so they are both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background Hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention, whilst the "Hockey Gear" image is used to break up the text so it isn't too overwhelming for the user and the "Hockey Rink" and "Team Logo" images are used to help the user understand the information better.
