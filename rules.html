                <h3>The Teams:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                     Each team is allowed a bench of between 20-23 players, with six players on the ice simultaneously. These usually consist of a goaltender, two defenders and three attackers, however, this lineup can change depending on the current situation in the game. For example, attacking players can be swapped for extra defenders if a team is winning or vice versa if they are losing and in some situations, the goaltender can be removed altogether to allow for an extra "outfield" player. The only time this isn't the case is when a team is killing a penalty, they will then be down by either one or two players depending on how many penalties are being sat. At all points, players are allowed to be subbed on and off as long as a team has no more than five active outfield players.
                </p>

            <div class="right-information">
                <h3>The Game:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Games are split into three 20-minute periods. The clock will keep running at all times unless there is either a penalty, a goal, the puck leaves the field of play or the goaltender freezes the puck, which is when they either catch the puck in their glove, to their body or apply <strong>controlled</strong> downward pressure when the puck is under their leg pads. When one of these happens the game is restarted with a faceoff in the designated zone. If after the 60 minutes there is a tied game, then there is a five-minute 3-Vs-3 (three outfield players and the goaltender) sudden death period. If the game is still tied then it will go to a penalty shootout. The only exception to this is in the Stanley Cup where there are no shootouts, the game keeps going till there is a winning goal.

                <h3>The Officials:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Each game has four officials officiating it. They will always be dressed in black and white striped shirts and black trousers, so players and fans will know who they are. There are two referees and two linesmen, one of each type in the two halves of the rink. The referee's main role is to watch the plays for any penalties, whilst the linesmen's main roles are to watch the blue lines for offsides and watch the goal lines during attacking plays to check if a puck fully crosses the line for a goal.
                </p>

                <h3>The Rink:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    An average hockey 60 metres long endboard to endboard and 30 metres wide and is divided into three zone, an offensive/ defensive zone for each team as well as a neutral zone in the centre. These zone divisions are represented by thick blue lines on the ice. Each offensive zone is 22.86 metres long which includes a 4 metres area behind each goal, whilst the neutral zone measures 14.28 meters blue line to blue line. There is also a thick red line 30 metres from each backboard to show the halfway line. There are also nine faceoff dots/ areas on the rink, two in each offensive area sat 8.4 meters from the backboard and 13.4 meters apart and five in the neutral zone, two spots 1.52 meters from each blue line and one in the centre of the rink where the game restarts after goals and to start periods.

                <h2>Penalties</h2>
                <hr>
                <div class="left-information">
                    <p>In Ice Hockey there are several different types of penalties that teams can commit resulting in different levels of punishment. The five main types of penalties are Game Stop, Minor, Major, Game and Team & Misconduct. Apart from Game Stop penalties, all penalties will result in the offending player or players having to sit in the penalty box for the duration of the penalty causing their team to be shorthanded and be on Walled the "Penalty Kill" or PK whilst their opponents are on a "Power Play" or PP. The only exception to this is if a goaltender is penalised, then a player who was on the ice at the time must sit it out for them.</p>

                <div class="left-information">
                    <h3>Game Stop</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Game Stop penalties are extremely minor infractions in the game where no player is required to sit out and the only punishment is a faceoff. <br> 
                        <strong> Here are the most common Game Stop offences: </strong><br>
                        <span class="offence">Icing:</span>When a player shoots the puck from their half of the rink over the opposing goal line. This results in a faceoff in the offending team's defensive zone. The only time Icing won't be called is if a team is on the Penalty Kill. <br> 
                        <span class="offence">Offside:</span>When either an attacking player enters the attacking zone before the puck on a drive or if the puck leaves the attacking they haven't exited the zone before it re-enters. This will result in a faceoff in the neutral zone by the defending team's blue line.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="left-information">
                    <h3>Minor</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Minor Penalties are the least severe penalties. They are minor or accidental infractions. They usually result in the offending player being in the box for two minutes however some minors can be doubled if multiple offences happen at the same time or if the offence is deemed worthy of a "Double Minor". <br>
                        <strong>Here is a list of the most common Minor penalties:</strong> <br>
                        <span class="offence">Tripping:</span> When a player uses their stick or part of their body to trip an opponent.<br>
                        <span class="offence">Hooking:</span> When a player uses their stick as a hook to slow down or impede an opponent.<br>
                        <span class="offence">Cross-Checking</span> When a player hits an opponent with the stick when both their hand and none of the stick is touching the ice. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Slashing:</span> When a player repeatedly swings the stick at an opponent and makes no contact with the puck. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Delay Of The Game:</span> When a player stalls the game. This is usually by either holding the puck in their hand or playing the puck straight out of bounds during a clearance without the puck making contact with anything on its way out (another player or the plexiglass around the rink). It can also occur if the goaltender takes control of the puck behind his goalline outside of the designated area known as the "trapezoid" <a href="#rink"><span class="empho">(see Diagram for more clarification)</span></a>. <br>
                        <span class="offence">High Sticking:</span> When a player makes contact with the opponent when their stick is over shoulder height. If the player draws blood, the penalty will be deemed a Double Minor and they will have to sit out for four minutes, if it is deemed to be deliberate and/ or malicious it can be upgraded to a Major or even Game penalty.<br>
                        <span class="offence">Roughing:</span> Whan a player shoves or pushes an opponent after the whistle or away from the play. <br>
                        <span class="offence">interference:</span> When a player impeeds an opponent who doesn't have the puck or impeeds any action from the bench like substitutions. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Holding:</span> When a player holds an opponent's body or equipment usually to stop them from advancing the play.<br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="left-information">
                    <h3>Major</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Major Penalties are deemed severe penalties. They are serious and deliberate infractions. They usually result in the offending player being in the box for five minutes. <br>
                        <strong>Here is a list of the most common Major penalties:</strong> <br>
                        <span class="offence">Fighting:</span> Fighting is when two players (usually on opposing teams) will drop their gloves and proceed to fight each other. Though there are no set rules for how they must go, it is most common for them to grab the front of their opponent's shirt whilst punching with the other hand. A fight ends when one participant touches the ice either by taking a knee or being wrestled to the ground. Both participants will usually receive a five minutes penalty but neither team will be down a player. The player who started the fight may receive two minutes Minor penalty for <strong>Instigation</strong> but this isn't always the case. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Boarding:</span> When a player checks an opposing player straight into the 1.22 meter high boards surrounding the rink and not the plexiglass. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Elbows, Heads and Knees:</span> When a player deliberately strikes another player with their Elbows or Knee or Headbutts them. Each of these can be upgraded to Game penalties if it is believed that the intent was to injure the player. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Charging:</span> When a player takes more than three strides or performs a jump before hitting an opponent. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Repeat Offending:</span> A player can be given a Major penalty if they are repeatedly called for minor penalties throughout a game. The number is up to the officials in charge but it is common that a 4th Minor penalty from a player in a game will be escalated to a Major.<br>

                    <h3>Game</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Game Penalties are the most serious and severe penalties. They are serious, deliberate infractions where it is believed the intent was to injure the opposing player and are commonly escalated from another Minor or Major penalty. They result in the offending player being ejected from the game meaning they will play no further part in the game. They usually also result in their team having a player sit the original penalty.<br>
                        <strong>Here is a list of the most common Game penalties:</strong> <br> 
                        <span class="offence">Spearing:</span> When a player stabs an opponent with the stick blade.<br>
                        <span class="offence">Grabbing The Face Mask:</span> When a player grabs and holds either the face visor or mask of an opposing player. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Goaltender Using The Blocker To Head:</span> When a goaltender uses the protective blocker (found o the hand they use their stick with) to strike a player either in the face or head. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Check To The Head:</span> When a player performs a check but makes full contact with the head of the checked player instead of the body. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Escalated Penalties:</span> When a Minor or Major penalty is escalated to a Game penalty due to intent and/or severity. <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="left-information">
                    <h3>Team & Misconduct</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Team and Misconduct penalties are infractions that are usually committed outside of the actual game itself and commonly committed after the whistle and during line changes. <br>
                        <strong>Here are a list of the most common Team & Misconduct penalties:</strong> <br>
                        <span class="offence">Too Many Men On the Ice:</span> This is when a team will have too many <strong>active</strong> players on the ice at one time. This is usually due to a mix-up during a line change. This results in a two minutes Minor penalty where one of the players that were on the ice at the time sits out the penalty. <br>
                        <span class="offence">Abuse Of An Official:</span> This is when either a player or coach is deemed to have used abusive language, remarks or actions towards an official. Depending on the severity of the abuse it will result in either a Minor, Major or even Game penalty being called on the offending player or the team. <br>
                        <span class="offence"> Unsportsman-Like Conduct:</span> This is similar to an "Abuse Of An Official" penalty but the actions are usually directed at either an opposing player, teammate or fan. Again depending on the severity Minor, Major and even Game penalties can be called against the offending player and/ or team.
