                <h3>The Teams:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                     Each team is allowed a bench of between 20-23 players, with six players on the ice at one time. These usually consisit of a goaltender, two defenders and three attackers, however this line up can change depending on the current situation in the game. For example attacking players can be swapped for extra defenders if a teams winning or vice versa if the losing and in some situations the goaltender can be removed all together to allow for an extra "out field" player. The only time this isn't the When a Willing a penalty, they will then be down by either one or two players depending on how many penalties are being sat. At all points players are allowed to be subbed on and off as long as a team has no more than five active out field player.

                <h3>The Game:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Games are split into three 20 minute periods. The clock will keep running at all times unless ther is either a penalty, a goal, the puck leaves the field of play or the goaltender freezes the puck, which is when they either catch the puck in their glove, to their body or apply <strong>controlled</strong> downward pressure when the puck is under their leg pads. When one of these happens the game is restarted with a faceoff in the designated zone. If after the 60 minutes there is a tied game, then there is a five minute 3-Vs-3 (three out field players and the goaltender) sudden death period. If the game is still tied then it will go to a penalty shootout. The only exception to this is in the Stanley Cup where there are no shootouts, the game keeps going till there is a winning goal.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Each game has four officials officiating over it. They will always be dressed in black and white striped shirts and black trousers, so players and fans will know who they are. There are two referees and two linesmen, one of each will be in each half of the rink. Referees main rolls are to watch the plays for any penalties, whilst the linesmen main roles are to watch the blue lines for offsides and watch the goalines during attacks to check if a puck fully crosses the line for a goal.

These zone divisions are represented by thick blue lines on the ice. Each offensive zone is 22.86 metres long which includes a 4 metres area behind each goal, whilst the neutral W4.28 meters. There is also a thick red line 30 metres from each backboard to show the halfway line.

                <hr>
                <div class="left-info">
                    <p>In Ice Hockey there are several different types of penalties that teams can commit resulting in different levels of punishment. The five main types of penalties are: Game Stop, Minor, Major, Game and Team & Misconduct. Apart from Game Stop penalties, all penalties will result in the offending player or players having to sit in the penalty box for the duration of the penalty causing their team to be shorthanded and be on Walled the "Penalty Kill" or PK whilst their opponents are on a "Power Play" or PP. The only exception to this is if a goaltender is penalised, then a player who was on the ice at the time must it sit for them.</p>

                    <h3>Game Stop</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Game Stop penalties are extremly minor infractions in the game where no player is required to sit out and the only punishment is a faceoff. <br> 
                        <strong> Here are the most common Game Stop offences: </strong><br>
                        <h4>Icing:</h4>When a player shoots the puck from their half of the rink over the opposing goal line. This results in a faceoff in the offending team's defensive zone. The only time Icing won't be caWf a team if on the Penalty Kill. <br> 
                        <h4>Offside:</h4>When either an attacking player enters the attacking zone before the puck on a drive or if the puck leaves the attacking they haven't exited the zone before it re-enters. This will result in a faceoff in the neutralzone by the defending teams blue line.

                    <h3>Minor</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Minor Penalties are the least severe penalties. They are minor or accidental infractions. They usually result in the offending player in the box for two minutes however some minors can be doubled if multiple offensive happen at the same time or if the offence if deemed worthy of a "Double Minor". <br>
                        <strong>Here are a list of the most common Minor penalties:</strong> <br>
                        <h4>Tripping:</h4> When a player uses their stick or part of their body to trip an opponent.<br>
                        <h4>Hooking:</h4> When a player uses their stick as a hook to slow down or impeed an opponent.<br>
                        <h4>Cross-Checking</h4> When a player hits an opponent with the stick when both their hand and none of the stick is touching the ice. <br>
                        <h4>Slashing:</h4> When a player repeatedly swings the stick at an opponent and make no contact with the puck. <br>
                        <h4>Delay Of The Game:</h4> When a player stalls the game. This is usually by either holding the puck in their hand or playing the puck straight out of bounds on a clearance without the puck making contact with anything on the way out (another player or the plexie glass around the rink). It can also occur if the goaltender takes control of the puck behind his goalline outside of the designated area know as the "trapezoid" <a href="#rink">(see Diagram for more clarification)</a>. <br>
                        <h4>High Sticking:</h4> When a player make contact with the opponent when their stick is over sholder height. If the player draws blood, the penalty will be deemed a Double Minor and they will have to sit out for four minutes and if it is deemed to be deliberate and/ or malicious it can be upgraded to a Major or even Game penalty.<br>
                        <h4>Roughing:</h4> Whan a player shoves or pushes an opponent after the whistle or away from the play.
                        <h4>interference:</h4> When a player impeeds an opponent who doesn't have the puck or impeeds any action from or the bench like substitutions. <br>
                        <h4>Holding:</h4> When a player holds an opponent's body or equipment usuallyto stop them advancing the play.<br>

                    <p>
                    Major Penalties are the deemed severe penalties. They are serious and deliberate infractions. They usually result in the offending player in the box for five minutes. <br>
                    <strong>Here are a list of the most common Major penalties:</strong> <br>
                    <h4>Fighting:</h4> Fighting is when two players (usually on opposing teams) will drop their gloves and proceed to fight each other. Though there are no set rules for how they must go, it is most common for the to grab the front of their opponent's shirt whilst punch with the other hands. A fight ends when one participant touches the ice either by taking a knee or being wrestled to the ground. Both participants will usually recieve 5 minute penalty but neither team will be down a player. The player who started the fight may receive a two  minute Minor for <strong>Instigation</strong>  but this isn't always the case. <br>
                    <h4>Boarding:</h4> When a player checks an opposing player straight into the 1.22 meter high boards surrounding the rink and not the plexie.
                    <h4>Elbows, Heads and Knees:</h4> When a player deliberatly strike another player with their Elbows or Knnee or Headbutts them. Each of these can be upgraded to Game penalties if it is believed that the intent was to injure the player.
                    <h4>Charging:</h4> When a player takes more than three strides or peforms a jump before hitting an opponent.
                    <h4>Repeat Offending:</h4> A player can be given a Major penalty if they are repeatedly called for minor penalties throughout a game. The number is up to the officials in charge but it is commonly that a 4th Minor penalty from a player in a game will be escalated to a Major.
