                    Ice Hockey is a fast paced, full-contact team sport played on ice covered hockey-like surface.
                    It's part of the hockey family of sports.
                    In this game, two teams compete against each other using sticks and a rubber disc known as a "puck".
                    The aim is to shoot the puck into the other team's goal, with each goal being a point and the team with the most goals winning.

                    It is widely believed that the chief inspiration for Ice Hockey as it is known today is a game called Bandy, originally played in Britain in the 18th and 19th Century.
                    It is also believed that when Bandy was brought to North America by British soldiers stationed in Eastern Canada in 1850's,
                    rules from the game Lacrosse were incorporated into Bandy giving the main foundation for what is now Ice Hockey.
