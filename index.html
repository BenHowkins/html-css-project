                    Ice Hockey is a full-contact, fast-paced team sport played on ice-covered hockey-like surface.
                    It's part of the hockey family of sports.
                    In this game, two teams compete against each other using sticks and a rubber disc which is known as a "puck".
                    The aim is to shoot the puck into the other team's goal, with each goal being a point and the team with the most goals winning.

                <h2>When Did Ice Hockey Begin?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    It is widely believed that the chief inspiration for Ice Hockey as it is known today is a game called Bandy, originally played in Britain in the 18th and 19th Centuries.
                    It is also believed that when Bandy was brought to North America by British soldiers stationed in Eastern Canada in the 1850s,
                    rules from the game Lacrosse were incorporated into Bandy giving the main foundation for what is now Ice Hockey.
